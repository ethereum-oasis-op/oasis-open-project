# Ethereum OASIS Open Project Charter 

## 1. Project Name
### 1.1 Full Name

Ethereum OASIS Open Project

### 1.2 Familiar Name

Ethereum OASIS Project

## 2. Abstract

The Ethereum OASIS Project exists to provide a neutral forum for diverse stakeholders to create high-quality specifications that facilitate Ethereum’s longevity, interoperability, and ease of integration. The Ethereum OASIS Project intends to develop clear, open standards, high-quality documentation, and shared test suites that facilitate new features and enhancements to the Ethereum protocol.

## 3. Purpose and Scope

The EIP process has led to a rich diverse engagement of developers in improving Ethereum - this decentralized ability of all to contribute ideas and features is a benefit to the ecosystem. This process has also led to EIPs of varying specificity, application, and quality, which presents a challenge to developers and organizations looking to adopt the most interoperable standards. 

The Ethereum OASIS Open Project seeks to address this problem and improve the interoperability of implementations for all. Working within a process that is predictable, fair, transparent, and time-tested, the Ethereum OASIS Project will provide a forum for producing standards in a style familiar to corporate contributors. Additionally, we wish for an Ethereum standard to be able to be blessed as more canonical among the sometimes mutually-exclusive EIPs. Finally, we also wish to ease the transition of technology and standards from Mainnet to private and/or permissioned chains such as those from the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

## 4. Business Benefits

The Ethereum OASIS Project is for:
* developers who wish to contribute to and shape the development of Ethereum.
* developers who wish to integrate Ethereum with other projects.
* project managers who wish to have a hand in Ethereum standards governance.
* those who prefer working within a more structured standards process.  OASIS Open Projects are meant to be bureaucracy that helps you and doesn't drive you crazy.

Common reasons for following this project are:
* see which Technical Steering Committees are active and their goals.
* stay abreast of the latest standards available for integrating into your own projects.
* engaging with Ethereum's development and standards in a more structured environment.  For something more free-form, look at the [EIP process](http://eips.ethereum.org).


## 5. Relationship to Other Projects

* [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals](https://bitcoincore.org/en/bips/) --- Bitcoin Core is usually more conservative in the upgrades they push forward, but ideas which start in Bitcoin will often make their way into the EIP or Ethereum OASIS Project.

* [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org) --- The Ethereum EIP process is less structured than the OASIS process---essentially anyone can create an EIP.  This sometimes creates confusion as different clients implement different EIPs.  One goal of the Ethereum Open Standards Project is to reduce the number of competing standards.  Exactly the right complementary relationship between EIPs and the Ethereum OASIS Open Project will be determined as we go.

* [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs) --- The equivalent of the EIP process for [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/).

* [Ethereum Enterprise Alliance standards](https://entethalliance.org/technical-documents/) --- The EEA takes work from EIPs and other mainnet Ethereum standards to synthesize a recommended standard for permissioned-chains that wish to be maximally compatible with mainnet Ethereum.
