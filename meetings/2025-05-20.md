            * New L2 standards repo: none
            * Proposed PGB resolution:
                * "RESOLVED that, in the event that the OASIS Ethereum OpenProject ceases to have any sponsor members of the PGB, this board and OASIS administration will regard the OpenProject as completed. Thereafter, the contents of existing project repos, as of the completion date, will continue to be available to the public under their current licenses, but OASIS will close the existing repos of the project to further input, and work with the project's current maintainers to pull or clone that content into new, renamed GitHub repositories, that can be managed by the maintainers, or successors they appoint, independently of OASIS. The current maintainers of the project are listed at the end of this resolution. \
 \
The PGB has been advised that other formal or informal groups working within the OpenProject are free to continue to self-perpetuate or reform, but must cease to describe themselves as OASIS activities. The trade name "OASIS" should no longer be used in the naming of any repo or any future project created from those re-hosted repos and any continuation activities for project work, except where pointers to the prior works or a general description of its history are required and an appropriate factual reference to OASIS. \
 \
Other naming conventions (such as a use of the word Ethereum, which is owned by others, that was used by the OASIS project by permission) for continuing or future work, will be used only if properly cleared by the owners of those marks. \
 \
The PGB hereby requests that the continuation-hosted repos be created at the termination of the project named as follows: [https://github.com/InterweaveZK/Baseline-Protocol](https://github.com/InterweaveZK/Baseline-Protocol)  \
 \
The PGB notes that the following persons currently serve as the maintainers of record for the repositories under the project as of the date: \
Sonal Patel- goldenbit0  \
Andreas Freund- therecanbeonlyone1969 \
Ognjen Kurtic- ognjenkurtic \
Bishwashree Dey- biscuitdey \
Stefan Kostic - skosito\
\
The PGB asks OASIS to turn over the ownership and the control of the domain [baseline-protocol.org](baseline-protocol.org) to Interweave Technologies Inc., as of the project’s closing date, for future use in connection with successor work, subject to appropriate documentation provided by OASIS. ”

                * The PGB voted on the resolution: 3 Yes, 0 No.  The resolution passed unanimously.
